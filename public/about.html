<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Lu√≠s, a passionate and creative junior web developer with a strong commitment to crafting clean, 
  user-friendly, and efficient websites. I embarked on my journey into web development through the online 
  Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu, where I acquired a solid foundation in both front-end and 
  back-end web development. During this immersive experience, I delved into various coding languages, 
  including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Git, Github, SQL, and more.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, I dedicated countless hours to mastering these skills, striving to become a 
  well-rounded web developer capable of creating diverse and functional websites. My goal is to ensure that 
  every site I build is not only efficient but also accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. 
  I take pride in writing clean and organized code, which allows for easy bug identification and correction, 
  ensuring a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I maintain a balanced lifestyle. I enjoy hitting the gym to stay physically fit, engage in 
  role-playing games (RPGs) with friends to foster creativity, and continually enhance my proficiency in 
  English. While my native language is Brazilian Portuguese, I currently reside in Brazil and recognize the 
  importance of being proficient in English for effective communication in the global web development community.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to explore my portfolio and don't hesitate to reach out. Whether you have a project in 
  mind or simply want to connect and expand our professional network, I'm eager to hear from you. Let's 
  collaborate to turn your web ideas into reality!</p>
